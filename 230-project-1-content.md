## My Game Idea

**High Concept:** It's like missle shooter but with power ups and goals!

**Genre:** strategy shooter game

**Platform:**Mobile friendly

**Story:**You have just been placed in charge of a city-wide defense center specializing in shooting meteors that fall to earth. Suddenly, you realize you are under attack! A metoeor shower threatens your city and you must shoot them down to protect your citizens. You can collect power-ups and bonuses that citizens throw into the sky for you. As time progresses, your city grows skyward and it becomes more time-essential to shoot meteors as soon as possible so no one gets hurt.

**Esthetics:** Cartoonish, possibly a little abstract. Background sound with be looped. A exxplosion noise for every successful hit, a ding noise for powerups, and screaming when a meteor hits the city. Every time your city grows skyward there will be a cheering sound.

**Gameplay:**

*   Mechanics: Behavioral momentum, Blissful productivity, Achievement, Endless Game, Fun once fun always

*   Control: left and right keys to aim, space to fire missle. On mobile device, turn left and right to aim, and tap to shoot.

*   Teaching: short tutorial

*   Learning: player needs to learn how fast the meteors are falling and adjuct to shooting them. They will need to know that the "clear metoers" powerup clears all meteors on screen, "explosion" powerup clears all meteors in a certain radius, and the "rapid automatic fire" powerup triggers automatic rapid shooting without the player having to tap/press the keyboard.
